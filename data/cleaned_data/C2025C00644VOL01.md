The object of this Act is to provide a balanced framework for
cooperative and productive workplace relations that promotes
national economic prosperity and social inclusion for all
Australians by:
(a) providing workplace relations laws that are fair to working
Australians, promote job security and gender equality, are

enforceable minimum terms and conditions through the
National Employment Standards, modern awards and
national minimum wage orders; and
(c) ensuring that the guaranteed safety net of fair, relevant and

undermined by the making of statutory individual
employment agreements of any kind given that such
agreements can never be part of a fair workplace relations
system; and
(ca) ensuring a safety net of fair and relevant minimum terms and
conditions for regulated workers through enforceable
minimum standards orders and related measures; and
(caa) ensuring a safety net of fair and relevant minimum terms and

responsibilities by providing for flexible working
arrangements; and

(b) the employee would be entitled to a casual loading or a
specific rate of pay for casual employees under the terms of a
fair work instrument if the employee were a casual employee,
or the employee is entitled to such a loading or rate of pay
under the contract of employment.
Note:
An employee who commences employment as a casual employee
remains a casual employee until the occurrence of a specified event
(see subsection (5)).
Indicia that apply for purposes of general rule
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), whether the employment
relationship is characterised by an absence of a firm advance
commitment to continuing and indefinite work is to be assessed:
(a) on the basis of the real substance, practical reality and true
nature of the employment relationship; and
(b) on the basis that a firm advance commitment can be in the
form of the contract of employment or, in addition to the
terms of that contract, in the form of a mutual understanding
or expectation between the employer and employee not rising
to the level of a term of that contract (or to a variation of any
such term); and
(c) having regard to, but not limited to, the following
considerations (which may indicate the presence, rather than
an absence, of such a commitment):
(i) whether there is an inability of the employer to elect to
offer, or not offer, work or an inability of the employee
to elect to accept or reject work (and whether this occurs
in practice);
(ii) whether, having regard to the nature of the employer’s
enterprise, it is reasonably likely that there will be future
availability of continuing work in that enterprise of the
kind usually performed by the employee;
(iii) whether there are full-time employees or part-time
employees performing the same kind of work in the
employer’s enterprise that is usually performed by the
employee;

(iv) whether there is a regular pattern of work for the
employee.
Note:
A regular pattern of work does not of itself indicate a firm advance
commitment to continuing and indefinite work. An employee who has
a regular pattern of work may still be a casual employee if there is no
firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work.
(3) To avoid doubt:
(a) for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), a mutual understanding
or expectation may be inferred from conduct of the employer
and employee after entering into the contract of employment
or from how the contract is performed; and
(b) the considerations referred to in paragraph (2)(c) must all be
considered but no single consideration is determinative and
not all considerations necessarily need to be satisfied for an
employee to be considered as other than a casual employee;
and
(c) a pattern of work is regular for the purposes of
subparagraph (2)(c)(iv) even if it is not absolutely uniform
and includes some fluctuation or variation over time
(including for reasonable absences such as for illness, injury
or recreation).
Exceptions to general rule
(4) Despite subsection (1), an employee is not a
casual employee
of an
employer if:
(a) the contract of employment includes a term that provides the
contract will terminate at the end of an identifiable period
(whether or not the contract also includes other terms that
provide for circumstances in which it may be terminated
before the end of that period); and
(b) the employee is a member of the academic staff or teaching
staff of a higher education institution; and
(c) the employee is covered by one of the following modern
awards:
(i) the Higher Education Industry-Academic Staff-Award
2020 as in force from time to time;

(d) the employee is not a State public sector employee of a State
within the meaning of subsection 30A(1).
Note 1:
A modern award covers an employee if the award is expressed to
cover the employee, even if the modern award does not apply to the
employee because an enterprise agreement applies to the employee in
relation to that particular employment (see subsection 57(1) which
deals with interaction between modern awards and enterprise
agreements).
Note 2:
This means an employee on a fixed term contract who is not covered
by paragraphs (4)(b) and (c) may be a casual employee or may be
other than a casual employee, depending on whether the employee
satisfies the requirements of subsections (1) to (3).
Employees engaged as casual employees remain so until the
occurrence of a specified event
(5) A person who commences employment as a casual employee
within the meaning of subsections (1) to (4) remains a
casual
employee
of the employer until:
(a) the employee’s employment status is changed to full-time
employment or part-time employment under Division 4A of
Part 2-2; or
(b) the employee’s employment status is changed by order of the
FWC under section 66MA or 739; or
(c) the employee’s employment status is changed to full-time
employment or part-time employment under the terms of a
fair work instrument that applies to the employee; or
(d) the employee accepts an alternative offer of employment
(other than as a casual employee) by the employer and
commences work on that basis.

### Part 2-1—Core provisions for this Chapter
#### Division 1—Introduction
###### 41  Guide to this Part
This Part has the core provisions for this Chapter, which deals with
terms and conditions of employment of national system employees.
The main terms and conditions come from the National
Employment Standards, modern awards, enterprise agreements and
workplace determinations.
The National Employment Standards (Part 2-2) are minimum terms
and conditions that apply to all national system employees.
A modern award (see Part 2-3), an enterprise agreement (see
Part 2-4) or a workplace determination (see Part 2-5) provides
terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom
the award, agreement or determination applies. Only one of those
instruments can apply to an employee at a particular time.
Division 2 has the provisions to enforce the National Employment
Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements. It also sets
out when a modern award or enterprise agreement applies to a
person and the significance of that for this Act.
Note:
In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were
an enterprise agreement in operation (see section 279). For the rules
about workplace determinations, see Part 2-5.
Division 3 deals with the interaction between the National
Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements.

Main terms and conditions
(1) The main terms and conditions of employment of an employee that
are provided under this Act are those set out in:
(a) the National Employment Standards (see Part 2-2); and
(b) a modern award (see Part 2-3), an enterprise agreement (see
Part 2-4) or a workplace determination (see Part 2-5) that
applies to the employee.
Note 1:
The situations in which a workplace determination, rather than a
modern award or enterprise agreement, provides an employee’s terms
and conditions of employment are limited. In most cases, this Act
applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise
agreement in operation (see section 279). See Part 2-5 generally for
the rules on workplace determinations.
Note 2:
Part 2-8 provides for the transfer of certain modern awards, enterprise
agreements and workplace determinations if there is a transfer of
business from an employee’s employer to another employer.
Note 3:
Copied State instruments provide the main terms and conditions of
employment for an employee to whom the instrument applies. See
Part 6-3A generally for the rules about those instruments.
Other terms and conditions
(2) In addition, other terms and conditions of employment include:
(a) those terms and conditions arising from:
(i) a national minimum wage order (see Part 2-6); or
(ii) an equal remuneration order (see Part 2-7); and
(b) those terms and conditions provided by Part 2-9.
Note:
Part 2-9 deals with miscellaneous terms and conditions of
employment, such as payment of wages.

Ancillary and supplementary terms may be included
(4) A modern award or enterprise agreement may also include the
following kinds of terms:
(a) terms that are ancillary or incidental to the operation of an
entitlement of an employee under the National Employment
Standards;
(b) terms that supplement the National Employment Standards;
but only to the extent that the effect of those terms is not
detrimental to an employee in any respect, when compared to the
National Employment Standards.
Note 1:
Ancillary or incidental terms permitted by paragraph (a) include (for
example) terms:
(a)
under which, instead of taking paid annual leave at the rate of
pay required by section 90, an employee may take twice as much
leave at half that rate of pay; or
(b)
that specify when payment under section 90 for paid annual leave
must be made.
Note 2:
Supplementary terms permitted by paragraph (b) include (for
example) terms:
(a)
that increase the amount of paid annual leave to which an
employee is entitled beyond the number of weeks that applies
under section 87; or
(b)
that provide for an employee to be paid for taking a period of
paid annual leave or paid/personal carer’s leave at a rate of pay
that is higher than the employee’s base rate of pay (which is the
rate required by sections 90 and 99).
Note 3:
Terms that would not be permitted by paragraph (a) or (b) include (for
example) terms requiring an employee to give more notice of the
taking of unpaid parental leave than is required by section 74.
Enterprise agreements may include terms that have the same effect
as provisions of the National Employment Standards
(5) An enterprise agreement may include terms that have the same (or
substantially the same) effect as provisions of the National
Employment Standards, whether or not ancillary or supplementary
terms are included as referred to in subsection (4).

Effect of terms that give an employee the same entitlement as under
the National Employment Standards
(6) To avoid doubt, if a modern award includes terms permitted by
subsection (4), or an enterprise agreement includes terms permitted
by subsection (4) or (5), then, to the extent that the terms give an
employee an entitlement (the
award or agreement entitlement
)
that is the same as an entitlement (the
NES entitlement
) of the
employee under the National Employment Standards:
(a) those terms operate in parallel with the employee’s NES
entitlement, but not so as to give the employee a double
benefit; and
(b) the provisions of the National Employment Standards
relating to the NES entitlement apply, as a minimum
standard, to the award or agreement entitlement.
Note:
For example, if the award or agreement entitlement is to 6 weeks of
paid annual leave per year, the provisions of the National Employment
Standards relating to the accrual and taking of paid annual leave will
apply, as a minimum standard, to 4 weeks of that leave.
Terms permitted by subsection (4) or (5) do not contravene
subsection (1)
(7) To the extent that a term of a modern award or enterprise
agreement is permitted by subsection (4) or (5), the term does not
contravene subsection (1).
Note:
A term of a modern award has no effect to the extent that it
contravenes this section (see section 56). An enterprise agreement that
includes a term that contravenes this section must not be approved
(see section 186) and a term of an enterprise agreement has no effect
to the extent that it contravenes this section (see section 56).

###### 59  Guide to this Part
This Part contains the National Employment Standards.
Division 2 identifies the National Employment Standards, the
detail of which is set out in Divisions 3 to 12.
Division 13 contains miscellaneous provisions relating to the
National Employment Standards.
The National Employment Standards are minimum standards that
apply to the
employment of
national system employees. Part 2-1
(which deals with the core provisions for this Chapter) contains the
obligation for employers to comply with the National Employment
Standards (see section 44).
The National Employment Standards also underpin what can be
included in modern awards and enterprise agreements. Part 2-1
provides that the National Employment Standards cannot be
excluded by modern awards or enterprise agreements, and contains
other provisions about the interaction between the National
Employment Standards and modern awards or enterprise
agreements (see sections 55 and 56).
Divisions 2, 2A and 3 of Part 6-3 extend the operation of the
parental leave, paid family and domestic violence leave and notice
of termination provisions of the National Employment Standards to
employees not otherwise covered by those provisions.

employed on that basis for a sequence of periods of
employment during a period of at least 12 months; and
(ii) has a reasonable expectation of continuing employment
by the employer on a regular and systematic basis.
(2A) For the purposes of applying paragraph (2)(a) in relation to an

(2) The response must:
(a) state that the employer grants the request; or
(b) if, following discussion between the employer and the
employee, the employer and the employee agree to a change
to the employee’s working arrangements that differs from
that set out in the request—set out the agreed change; or
(c) subject to subsection (3)—state that the employer refuses the
request and include the matters required by subsection (6).
(3) The employer may refuse the request only if:
(a) the employer has:
(i) discussed the request with the employee; and
(ii) genuinely tried to reach an agreement with the
employee about making changes to the employee’s
working arrangements to accommodate the
circumstances mentioned in subsection (1); and
(b) the employer and the employee have not reached such an
agreement; and
(c) the employer has had regard to the consequences of the
refusal for the employee; and
(d) the refusal is on reasonable business grounds.
Note:
An employer’s grounds for refusing a request may be taken to be
reasonable business grounds, or not to be reasonable business
grounds, in certain circumstances: see subsection 65C(5).

(b) that there is no capacity to change the working arrangements
of other employees to accommodate the new working
arrangements requested;
(c) that it would be impractical to change the working
arrangements of other employees, or recruit new employees,
to accommodate the new working arrangements requested;
(d) that the new working arrangements requested would be likely

to have a significant negative impact on customer service.
Note:
The specific circumstances of the employer, including the nature and
size of the enterprise carried on by the employer, are relevant to
whether the employer has reasonable business grounds for refusing a
request for the purposes of paragraph (3)(d) and subsection (4). For
example, if the employer has only a small number of employees, there
may be no capacity to change the working arrangements of other
employees to accommodate the request (see paragraph (5)(b)).
Employer must explain grounds for refusal
(6) If the employer refuses the request, the written response under
subsection (1) must:
(a) include details of the reasons for the refusal; and
(b) without limiting paragraph (a) of this subsection:
(i) set out the employer’s particular business grounds for
refusing the request; and
(ii) explain how those grounds apply to the request; and
(c) either:
(i) set out the changes (other than the requested change) in
the employee’s working arrangements that would
accommodate, to any extent, the circumstances
mentioned in subsection (1) and that the employer
would be willing to make; or
(ii) state that there are no such changes; and
(d) set out the effect of sections 65B and 65C.

taken to have refused the request.
(5) If the FWC makes an order under paragraph (1)(b), the grounds on
which the employer refuses the request are taken:

parental leave under section 70.
Note 2:
The number of days of flexible unpaid parental leave that the
employee takes must not be more than the number of flexible days
notified to the employer under subsection 74(3C) (subject to any

full to pregnant part-time employees and pregnant casual
employees.
(2C) The amount of flexible unpaid parental leave to which an employee
is entitled under subsection (1) in relation to the child is reduced by
the number of days of flexible unpaid parental leave taken by the
employee under subsection (2A) in relation to the child.
How flexible unpaid parental leave may be taken
(3) The employee must take the flexible unpaid parental leave as:
(a) a single continuous period of one or more days; or
(b) separate periods of one or more days each.
Effect of taking unpaid parental leave under other provisions
(4) The employee may take the flexible unpaid parental leave whether
or not the employee has taken unpaid parental leave under another
provision of this Division in relation to the child.
(5) However, the employee may take flexible unpaid parental leave
after taking one or more periods of unpaid parental leave under
another provision of this Division only if the total of those periods
(disregarding any extension under section 76A) is no longer than

notional flexible
period
is the period during which
the employee would be on flexible unpaid parental leave if the
employee took leave for all the employee’s flexible days in a single
continuous period. For this purpose, the employee’s flexible days
are the flexible days notified to the employer under

###### 76A  Responding to requests for extension of unpaid parental leave
Responding to the request
(1) If, under subsection 76(1), an employee requests an employer to
agree to an extension of unpaid parental leave for the employee for
a further period of up to 12 months immediately following the end
of the available parental leave period, the employer must give the

(ii) genuinely tried to reach an agreement with the
employee about an extension of the period of unpaid
parental leave for the employee; and
(b) the employer and the employee have not reached such an
agreement; and
(c) the employer has had regard to the consequences of the
refusal for the employee; and
(d) the refusal is on reasonable business grounds.
Note:
An employer’s grounds for refusing a request may be taken to be
reasonable business grounds, or not to be reasonable business
grounds, in certain circumstances (see subsection 76C(6)).
(4) To avoid doubt, subparagraph (3)(a)(ii) does not require the
employer to agree to an extension of the period of unpaid parental
leave for the employee if the employer would have reasonable
business grounds for refusing a request for the extension.
Reasonable business grounds for refusing requests
(5) Without limiting what are reasonable business grounds for the
purposes of paragraph (3)(d) and subsection (4), reasonable
business grounds for refusing a request include the following:
(a) that the extension of the period of unpaid parental leave
requested by the employee would be too costly for the
employer;
(b) that there is no capacity to change the working arrangements
of other employees to accommodate the extension of the
period of unpaid parental leave requested by the employee;
(c) that it would be impractical to change the working
arrangements of other employees, or recruit new employees,
to accommodate the extension of the period of unpaid
parental leave requested by the employee;
(d) that the extension of the period of unpaid parental leave
requested by the employee would be likely to result in a
significant loss in efficiency or productivity;

(e) that the extension of the period of unpaid parental leave
requested by the employee would be likely to have a
significant negative impact on customer service.
Note:
The specific circumstances of the employer, including the nature and
size of the enterprise carried on by the employer, are relevant to
whether the employer has reasonable business grounds for refusing a
request for the purposes of paragraph (3)(d) and subsection (4). For
example, if the employer has only a small number of employees, there
may be no capacity to change the working arrangements of other
employees to accommodate the request (see paragraph (5)(b)).
Employer must explain grounds for refusal
(6) If the employer refuses the request, the written response under
subsection (1) must:
(a) include details of the reasons for the refusal; and
(b) without limiting paragraph (a) of this subsection:
(i) set out the employer’s particular business grounds for
refusing the request; and
(ii) explain how those grounds apply to the request; and
(c) either:
(i) set out the extension of the period of unpaid parental
leave for the employee (other than the period requested
by the employee) that the employer would be willing to
agree to; or
(ii) state that there is no extension of the period that the
employer would be willing to agree to; and
(d) set out the effect of sections 76B and 76C.

###### 76B  Disputes about extension of period of unpaid parental leave
Application of this section
(1) This section applies to a dispute between an employer and an
employee that relates to a request by the employee to the employer
under subsection 76(1) to agree to an extension of unpaid parental
leave for the employee for a further period of up to 12 months
immediately following the end of the available parental leave
period if:
(a) the employer has refused the request; or
(b) 21 days have passed since the employee made the request,
and the employer has not given the employee a written
response to the request under section 76A.
Note 1:
Modern awards and enterprise agreements must include a term that
provides a procedure for settling disputes in relation to the National
Employment Standards (see paragraph 146(b) and subsection 186(6)).
Note 2:
Subsection 55(4) permits inclusion of terms that are ancillary or
incidental to, or that supplement, the National Employment Standards.
However, a term of a modern award or an enterprise agreement has no
effect to the extent it contravenes section 55 (see section 56).
Resolving disputes
(2) In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must attempt to
resolve the dispute at the workplace level, by discussions between
the parties.
FWC may deal with disputes
(3) If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a
party to the dispute may refer the dispute to the FWC.
(4) If a dispute is referred under subsection (3):
(a) the FWC must first deal with the dispute by means other than
arbitration, unless there are exceptional circumstances; and
(b) the FWC may deal with the dispute by arbitration in
accordance with section 76C.

Note:
For the purposes of paragraph (a), the FWC may deal with the dispute
as it considers appropriate. The FWC commonly deals with disputes
by conciliation. The FWC may also deal with the dispute by
mediation, making a recommendation or expressing an opinion (see
subsection 595(2)).
Representatives
(5) The employer or employee may appoint a person or industrial
association to provide the employer or employee (as the case may
be) with support or representation for the purposes of:
(a) resolving the dispute; or
(b) the FWC dealing with the dispute.
Note:
A person may be represented by a lawyer or paid agent in a matter
before the FWC only with the permission of the FWC (see
section 596).
###### 76C  Arbitration
(1) For the purposes of paragraph 76B(4)(b), the FWC may deal with
the dispute by arbitration by making any of the following orders:
(a) if the employer has not given the employee a written
response to the request under section 76A—an order that the
employer be taken to have refused the request;
(b) if the employer refused the request:
(i) an order that it would be appropriate for the grounds on
which the employer refused the request to be taken to
have been reasonable business grounds; or
(ii) an order that it would be appropriate for the grounds on
which the employer refused the request to be taken not
to have been reasonable business grounds;
(c) if the FWC is satisfied that the employer has not responded,
or has not responded adequately, to the employee’s request
under section 76A—an order that the employer take such
further steps as the FWC considers appropriate, having
regard to the matters in section 76A;
(d) subject to subsection (4) of this section:
(i) an order that the employer grant the request; or

(ii) an order that the employer agree to an extension of
unpaid parental leave for the employee for a further
period of up to 12 months (other than the period
requested by the employee) immediately following the
end of the available parental leave period.
Note:
An order by the FWC under paragraph (c) could, for example, require
the employer to give a response, or further response, to the
employee’s request, and could set out matters that must be included in
the response or further response.
(2) In making an order under subsection (1), the FWC must take into
account fairness between the employer and the employee.
(3) The FWC must not make an order under paragraph (1)(c) or (d)
that would be inconsistent with:
(a) a provision of this Act; or
(b) a term of a fair work instrument (other than an order made
under that paragraph) that, immediately before the order is
made, applies to the employer and employee.
(4) The FWC may make an order under paragraph (1)(d) only if the
FWC is satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of the dispute
being resolved without the making of such an order.
(5) If the FWC makes an order under paragraph (1)(a), the employer is
taken to have refused the request.
(6) If the FWC makes an order under paragraph (1)(b), the grounds on
which the employer refuses the request are taken:
(a) for an order made under subparagraph (1)(b)(i)—to be
reasonable business grounds; or
(b) for an order made under subparagraph (1)(b)(ii)—not to be
reasonable business grounds.
Contravening an order under subsection (1)
(7) A person must not contravene a term of an order made under
subsection (1).

Compilation No. 69
Compilation date: 07/11/2025
###### 77  Reducing period of unpaid parental leave
If the employer agrees, an employee whose period of unpaid
parental leave has started may reduce the period of unpaid parental
leave the employee takes.
###### 77A  Effect of stillbirth or death of child on unpaid parental leave
Stillbirth—preserving entitlement to birth-related leave
(1) If:
(a) a child is stillborn; and
(b) an employee would have been entitled to unpaid parental
leave that is birth-related leave, if the child had been born
alive;
then the employee is taken to be entitled to the unpaid parental
leave, despite the stillbirth of the child.
Note:
In addition, an employer generally must not refuse or cancel
employer-funded paid parental leave for an employee because the
employee’s child is stillborn or dies (see section 333X).
(2) A
stillborn
child is a child:
(a) who weighs at least 400 grams at delivery or whose period of
gestation was at least 20 weeks; and
(b) who has not breathed since delivery; and
(c) whose heart has not beaten since delivery.
(3) The provisions of this Division have effect in relation to the
employee as if the birth of a child included the stillbirth of a child.
Note:
One effect of this subsection is that if the employee has not given
notice in accordance with section 74 before the stillbirth of the child,
the employee can do so as soon as practicable (which may be a time
after the leave has started).
Stillbirth or death of child—cancelling leave or returning to work
(4) If a child is stillborn, or dies during the 24-month period starting
on the child’s date of birth, then an employee who is entitled to a
period of unpaid parental leave in relation to the child may:

(a) before the period of leave starts, give the employee’s
employer written notice cancelling the leave; or
(b) if the period of leave has started, give the employee’s
employer written notice that the employee wishes to return to
work on a specified day.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), the specified day must be at
least 4 weeks after the employer receives the notice.
(6) If the employee takes action under subsection (4), the employee’s
entitlement to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child ends:
(a) if the action is taken under paragraph (4)(a)—immediately
after the cancellation of the leave; or
(b) if the action is taken under paragraph (4)(b)—immediately
before the specified day.
Interaction with section 77
(7) Subsections (4) to (6) do not limit section 77 (which deals with the
employee reducing the period of unpaid parental leave with the
agreement of the employer).
###### 78  Employee who ceases to have responsibility for care of child
(1) This section applies to an employee who has taken unpaid parental
leave in relation to a child if the employee ceases to have any
responsibility for the care of the child for a reason other than
because the child:
(a) is stillborn; or
(b) dies during the 24-month period starting on the child’s date
of birth.
(2) The employer may give the employee written notice requiring the
employee to return to work on a specified day.
(3) The specified day:
(a) must be at least 4 weeks after the notice is given to the
employee; and

(4) The employee’s entitlement to unpaid parental leave in relation to
the child ends immediately before the specified day.
###### 78A  Hospitalised children
Agreeing to not take unpaid parental leave for a period while child
remains in hospital
(1) If:
(a) a child is required to remain in hospital after the child’s birth,
or is hospitalised immediately after the child’s birth,
including because:
(i) the child was born prematurely; or
(ii) the child developed a complication or contracted an
illness during the child’s period of gestation or at birth;
or
(iii) the child developed a complication or contracted an
illness following the child’s birth; and
(b) an employee, whether before or after the birth of the child,
gives notice in accordance with section 74 of the taking of a
period of unpaid parental leave (the
original leave period
) in
relation to the child;
then the employee may agree with the employee’s employer that
the employee will not take unpaid parental leave for a period (the
permitted work period
) while the child remains in hospital.
Note:
Section 344 prohibits the exertion of undue influence or undue
pressure on the employee in relation to a decision by the employee
whether to agree.
(2) If the employee and employer so agree, then the following rules
have effect:
(a) the employee is taken to not be taking unpaid parental leave
during the permitted work period;

(b) the permitted work period does not break the continuity of
the original leave period;
(c) the employee is taken to have advised the employer, for the
purposes of subsection 74(4), of an end date for the original
leave period that is the date on which that period would end
if it were extended by a period equal to the permitted work
period.
Note:
One effect of paragraph (b) is that, if the employee takes periods of
unpaid parental leave either side of the permitted work period, the
periods are still treated as a single continuous period for the purposes
of section 71.
When permitted work period must start
(3) The permitted work period must start after the birth of the child.
When permitted work period ends
(4) The permitted work period ends at the earliest of the following:
(a) the time agreed by the employee and employer;
(b) the end of the day of the child’s first discharge from hospital
after birth;
(c) if the child dies before being discharged—the end of the day
the child dies.
Only one permitted work period allowed
(5) Only one period may be agreed to under subsection (1) for which
the employee will not take unpaid parental leave in relation to the
child.
Evidence
(6) The employee must, if required by the employer, give the employer
evidence that would satisfy a reasonable person of either or both of
the following:
(a) that paragraph (1)(a) applies in relation to the child;
(b) that the employee is fit for work.

Personal information given to an employer under this section may be

###### 79  Interaction with paid leave
(1) This Subdivision (except for subsections (2) and (3)) does not
prevent an employee from taking any other kind of paid leave
while the employee is taking unpaid parental leave. If the
employee does so, the taking of that other paid leave does not
break the continuity of the period of unpaid parental leave.
Note:
For example, if the employee has paid annual leave available, the
employee may (with the employer’s agreement) take some or all of
that paid annual leave at the same time as the unpaid parental leave.
(2) While an employee is taking unpaid parental leave, the employee is
not entitled to take:
(a) paid personal/carer’s leave; or
(b) compassionate leave, unless the permissible occasion is the
stillbirth or death of the child in relation to whom the
employee is taking unpaid parental leave.
(3) An employee is not entitled to any payment under Division 8
(which deals with community service leave) in relation to activities
the employee engages in while taking unpaid parental leave.
###### 79A  Keeping in touch days
(1) This Subdivision does not prevent an employee from performing
work for the employee’s employer on a keeping in touch day while
the employee is taking unpaid parental leave. If the employee does
so, the performance of that work does not break the continuity of
the period of unpaid parental leave.
(2) A day on which the employee performs work for the employer
during the period of leave is a
keeping in touch day
if:
(a) the purpose of performing the work is to enable the employee
to keep in touch with the employee’s employment in order to

(b) both the employee and the employer consent to the employee
performing work for the employer on that day; and
(c) the day is not within:
(i) if the employee suggested or requested that the
employee perform work for the employer on that day—
14 days after the date of birth, or day of placement, of
the child to which the period of leave relates; or
(ii) otherwise—42 days after the date of birth, or day of
placement, of the child; and
(d) the employee has not already performed work for the
employer or another entity on 10 days during the period of
leave that were keeping in touch days.
The duration of the work the employee performs on that day is not
relevant for the purposes of this subsection.
Note:
The employer will be obliged, under the relevant contract of
employment or industrial instrument, to pay the employee for
performing work on a keeping in touch day.
(3) The employee’s decision whether to give the consent mentioned in
paragraph (2)(b) is taken, for the purposes of section 344 (which
deals with undue influence or pressure), to be a decision to make,
or not make, an arrangement under the National Employment
Standards.
(4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), treat as 2 separate periods of
unpaid parental leave:
(a) a period of unpaid parental leave taken during the employee’s
available parental leave period; and
(b) a period of unpaid parental leave taken as an extension of the
leave referred to in paragraph (a) for a further period
immediately following the end of the available parental leave
period.

leave.

the employee’s employer evidence that would satisfy a reasonable
person that the employee is fit for work, but that it is inadvisable
for the employee to continue in the employee’s present position
during a stated period (the

) because of:
(a) illness, or risks, arising out of the employee’s pregnancy; or
(b) hazards connected with that position.

of paid family and domestic violence leave, the employer must pay
the employee, in relation to the period:

###### 116  Payment for absence on public holiday
If, in accordance with this Division, an employee is absent from his
or her employment on a day or part-day that is a public holiday, the
employer must pay the employee at the employee’s base rate of

### Part 2-3—Modern awards
#### Division 1—Introduction
###### 132  Guide to this Part
This Part provides for the FWC to make, vary and revoke modern
awards. Modern awards may set minimum terms and conditions for
national system employees in particular industries or occupations.
Modern awards can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary
to the National Employment Standards (see Part 2-1).
Division 2 provides for the modern awards objective. This requires
the FWC to ensure that modern awards, together with the National
Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant minimum
safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account certain
social and economic factors. Division 2 also contains special
provisions about modern award minimum wages.
Division 3 deals with the terms of modern awards.
Division 4A provides for the FWC to conduct 4 yearly reviews of
default fund terms of modern awards.
It also sets out the process for making the Schedule of Approved
Employer MySuper products in a 4 yearly review, and amending
the schedule after it is made to include other employer MySuper
products. If an employer MySuper product is on the schedule, an
employer covered by a modern award can make contributions, for
the benefit of a default fund employee, to a superannuation fund
that offers the product (see subsection 149D(1A)).
Division 5 provides for the FWC to exercise modern award powers
in certain circumstances.

minimum wages). The following is a summary of the FWC’s
powers under the 2 Parts:
(a)
the initial making of a modern award setting modern
award minimum wages can only occur under this Part;
(b)
the main power to vary modern award minimum wages
is in annual wage reviews under Part 2-6;
(c)
modern award minimum wages can also be varied under
this Part, but only for work value reasons or in other
limited circumstances;
(d)
modern award minimum wages can be set (otherwise
than in the initial making of a modern award) or revoked
either under this Part or in annual wage reviews under
Part 2-6.

###### 134  The modern awards objective
What is the modern awards objective?
(1) The FWC must ensure that modern awards, together with the
National Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant
minimum safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account:
(a) relative living standards and the needs of the low paid; and
(aa) the need to improve access to secure work across the
economy; and
(ab) the need to achieve gender equality in the workplace by
ensuring equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable
value, eliminating gender-based undervaluation of work and
providing workplace conditions that facilitate women’s full
economic participation; and
(b) the need to encourage collective bargaining; and
(c) the need to promote social inclusion through increased
workforce participation; and
(d) the need to promote flexible modern work practices and the
efficient and productive performance of work; and
(da) the need to provide additional remuneration for:
(i) employees working overtime; or
(ii) employees working unsocial, irregular or unpredictable
hours; or
(iii) employees working on weekends or public holidays; or
(iv) employees working shifts; and
(f) the likely impact of any exercise of modern award powers on
business, including on productivity, employment costs and
the regulatory burden; and
(g) the need to ensure a simple, easy to understand, stable and
sustainable modern award system for Australia that avoids
unnecessary overlap of modern awards; and

(h) the likely impact of any exercise of modern award powers on
employment growth, inflation and the sustainability,
performance and competitiveness of the national economy.
This is the
modern awards objective
.
When does the modern awards objective apply?
(2) The modern awards objective applies to the performance or
exercise of the FWC’s
modern award powers
, which are:
(a) the FWC’s functions or powers under this Part; and
(b) the FWC’s functions or powers under Part 2-6, so far as they
relate to modern award minimum wages.
Note 1:
The FWC must also take into account the objects of this Act and any
other applicable provisions. For example, if the FWC is setting,
varying or revoking modern award minimum wages, the minimum
wages objective also applies (see section 284).
Note 2:
Further, the FWC must take into account the road transport objective
when performing certain functions: see section 40D and
subsection 617(10B).
###### 135  Special provisions relating to modern award minimum wages
(1) Modern award minimum wages cannot be varied under this Part
except as follows:
(a) modern award minimum wages can be varied if the FWC is
satisfied that the variation is justified by work value reasons
(see subsection 157(2));
(b) modern award minimum wages can be varied under
section 160 (which deals with variation to remove
ambiguities or correct errors) or section 161 (which deals
with variation on referral by the Australian Human Rights
Commission).
Note 1:
The main power to vary modern award minimum wages is in annual
wage reviews under Part 2-6. Modern award minimum wages can also
be set or revoked in annual wage reviews.
Note 2:
For the meanings of
modern award minimum wages
, and
setting
and
varying
such wages, see section 284.

###### 135A  Special provisions relating to penalty rates and overtime rates
(1) In exercising its powers under this Part to make, vary or revoke
modern awards, the FWC must ensure that:
(a) the rate of a penalty rate or an overtime rate that employees
are entitled to receive is not reduced; and
(b) modern awards do not include terms that substitute
employees’ entitlements to receive penalty rates or overtime
rates where those terms would have the effect of reducing the
additional remuneration referred to in paragraph 134(1)(da)
that any employee would otherwise receive.
(2) Subsection (1) does not limit the operation of section 144
(flexibility terms) or section 160 (which deals with variation to
remove ambiguities or correct errors).
(3) Nothing in subsection (1) requires the FWC to exercise its powers
under this Part to make, vary or revoke modern awards.

default fund term of the award; or
(b) make a modern award; or
(c) make a determination revoking a modern award;
if the FWC is satisfied that making the determination or modern
award is necessary to achieve the modern awards objective.
Note 1:
Generally, the FWC must be constituted by a Full Bench to make,
vary or revoke a modern award. However, the President may direct a
single FWC Member to make a variation (see section 616).
Note 2:
Special criteria apply to changing coverage of modern awards or
revoking modern awards (see sections 163 and 164).
Note 3:
If the FWC is setting modern award minimum wages, the minimum
wages objective also applies (see section 284).
Note 4:
If the FWC is making, varying or revoking a modern award that the
President considers might relate to the road transport industry, it must
take into account the road transport objective (see section 40D).
(2) The FWC may make a determination varying modern award
minimum wages if the FWC is satisfied that:
(a) the variation of modern award minimum wages is justified by
work value reasons; and
(b) making the determination outside the system of annual wage
reviews is necessary to achieve the modern awards objective.
Note:
As the FWC is varying modern award minimum wages, the minimum
wages objective also applies (see section 284).

#### Division 1—Introduction
###### 169  Guide to this Part
This Part is about enterprise agreements. An enterprise agreement
is made at the enterprise level and provides terms and conditions
for those national system employees to whom it applies. An
enterprise agreement can have terms that are ancillary or
supplementary to the National Employment Standards.
Division 2 deals with the making of enterprise agreements about
permitted matters. An enterprise agreement (including a
greenfields agreement) may be a single-enterprise agreement or a
multi-enterprise agreement.
Division 3 deals with the right of employees to be represented by a
bargaining representative during bargaining for a proposed
enterprise agreement. It also sets out the persons who are
bargaining representatives for such agreements.
Subdivision A of Division 4 deals with the approval of proposed
enterprise agreements by employees and sets out when an
enterprise agreement is made.
Subdivision B of Division 4 deals with the approval of enterprise
agreements by the FWC. The remaining Subdivisions of the
Division deal with certain approval requirements, including in
relation to genuine agreement by employees and the better off
overall test.
Division 5 deals with the mandatory terms of enterprise
agreements relating to individual flexibility arrangements,
consultation requirements and the rights of workplace delegates.

Division 6 deals with the base rate of pay under an enterprise
agreement.
Division 7 deals with the variation and termination of enterprise
agreements.
Division 8 provides for the FWC to facilitate bargaining by making
bargaining orders, intractable bargaining declarations, majority
support determinations and scope orders. It also permits bargaining
representatives to apply for the FWC to deal with bargaining
disputes.
Division 9 provides for the making of supported bargaining
authorisations in relation to proposed multi-enterprise agreements.
The effect of such an authorisation is that specified employers are
subject to certain rules that would not otherwise apply (for
example, bargaining orders that would not usually be available for
multi-enterprise agreements will be available). It also permits the
FWC to assist the bargaining representatives for such agreements.
Division 10 deals with single interest employer authorisations.
Division 11 deals with other matters relating to enterprise
agreements.

##### Subdivision C—Better off overall test
###### 193  Passing the better off overall test
When a non-greenfields agreement passes the better off overall test
(1) An enterprise agreement that is not a greenfields agreement
passes
the better off overall test
under this section if the FWC is satisfied,
as at the test time, that:
(a) each award covered employee, and each reasonably
foreseeable employee, for the agreement would be better off
overall if the agreement applied to the employee than if the
relevant modern award applied to the employee; and
(b) if the agreement is a single-enterprise agreement that covers
one or more employees (each of whom is an
old agreement
employee
) to whom a supported bargaining agreement or a
single interest employer agreement applies—each old
agreement employee would be better off overall if the
single-enterprise agreement applied to the employee than if
the supported bargaining agreement or single interest
employer agreement (as the case requires) applied to the
employee.
Note 1:
Reasonably foreseeable employee
is defined in subsection (5).
Note 2:
Section 193A sets out rules for applying the better off overall test,
including requiring the FWC to only have regard to patterns or kinds
of work, or types of employment, that are reasonably foreseeable at
the test time (see subsection 193A(6)).
(1A) If an employee is, at the test time, both an old agreement employee
and an award covered employee, the FWC must undertake an
assessment against only paragraph (1)(b) for that employee.
FWC must disregard individual flexibility arrangement
(2) If, under the flexibility term in the relevant modern award, an
individual flexibility arrangement has been agreed to by an award
covered employee and his or her employer, the FWC must
disregard the individual flexibility arrangement for the purposes of

test.
(2A) If, under the flexibility term in the supported bargaining agreement
or single interest employer agreement, an individual flexibility
arrangement has been agreed to by an old agreement employee and
his or her employer, the FWC must disregard the individual
flexibility arrangement for the purposes of determining whether the
single-enterprise agreement passes the better off overall test.
When a greenfields agreement passes the better off overall test
(3) A greenfields agreement
passes the
better off overall test
under
this section if the FWC is satisfied, as at the test time, that each
reasonably foreseeable employee for the agreement would be better
off overall if the agreement applied to the employee than if the
relevant modern award applied to the employee.
Award covered employee
(4) An
award covered employee
for an enterprise agreement is an
employee who:
(a) is covered by the agreement; and
(b) at the test time, is covered by a modern award (the
relevant
modern award
) that:
(i) is in operation; and
(ii) covers the employee in relation to the work that he or
she is to perform under the agreement; and
(iii) covers his or her employer.
Reasonably foreseeable employee
(5) A
reasonably foreseeable employee
for an enterprise agreement is
a person who, if he or she were an employee at the test time of an
employer covered by the agreement:
(a) would be covered by the agreement; and
(b) would be covered by a modern award (the
relevant modern
award
) that:

(6) The
test time
is the time the application for approval of the
agreement by the FWC was made under subsection 182(4) or
section 185.
###### 193A  Applying the better off overall test
(1) This section applies for the purposes of determining whether an
enterprise agreement passes the better off overall test under
section 193.
(2) To avoid doubt, the FWC must undertake a global assessment of
whether each employee concerned would be better off having
regard to:
(a) the terms of the agreement which would be more beneficial
to the employee if the agreement applied to the employee
than if the relevant modern award, supported bargaining
agreement or single interest employer agreement (as the case
requires) applied to the employee; and
(b) the terms of the agreement which would be less beneficial to
the employee if the agreement applied to the employee than
if the relevant modern award, supported bargaining
agreement or single interest employer agreement (as the case
requires) applied to the employee.
(3) The FWC must give consideration to any views relating to whether
the agreement passes the better off overall test that have been
expressed by any of the following:
(a) the employer or employers that are covered by the
agreement;
(b) if the agreement is not a greenfields agreement:
(i) the award covered employees for the agreement; and

(ii) if the agreement is a single-enterprise agreement that
covers one or more employees to whom a supported
bargaining agreement or a single interest employer
agreement applies—those employees;
(c) in any case—a bargaining representative for the agreement.
(4) The FWC must give primary consideration to a common view (if
any) relating to whether the agreement passes the better off overall
test expressed by all of the following:
(a) the bargaining representative or bargaining representatives of
the employer or employers that are covered by the
agreement;
(b) the bargaining representative or bargaining representatives of
award covered employees for the agreement (other than a
bargaining representative that is not an employee
organisation);
(c) if the agreement is a single-enterprise agreement that covers
one or more employees to whom a supported bargaining
agreement or a single interest employer agreement applies—
the bargaining representative or bargaining representatives of
those employees (other than a bargaining representative that
is not an employee organisation).
(5) Subsection (4) does not apply if the agreement is a greenfields
agreement.
(6) The FWC may only have regard to patterns or kinds of work, or
types of employment, if they are reasonably foreseeable at the test
time. In considering what is reasonably foreseeable, the FWC must
have regard to the nature of the enterprise or enterprises to which
the agreement relates.
(6A) The FWC must determine whether a particular pattern or kind of
work, or type of employment, is reasonably foreseeable for the
purposes of subsection (6) if a view is expressed by any of the
following that it is, or is not, reasonably foreseeable:
(a) the employer or employers that are covered by the
agreement;

(7) If a class of employees to which a particular employee belongs
would be better off if the agreement applied to that class than if the
relevant modern award, supported bargaining agreement or single
interest employer agreement (as the case requires) applied to that
class, the FWC is entitled to assume, in the absence of evidence to
the contrary, that the employee would be better off overall if the
agreement applied to the employee.

violence, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction
or social origin.
Certain terms are not discriminatory terms
(2) A term of an enterprise agreement does not discriminate against an
employee:
(a) if the reason for the discrimination is the inherent
requirements of the particular position concerned; or

the employee as a member of the staff of an institution that is
conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or
teachings of a particular religion or creed:
(i) in good faith; and
(ii) to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of

(b) for that purpose as well as other purposes, whether or not that
purpose is the dominant or substantial one.
(6) However, a term of an enterprise agreement ceases to be a

(a) the FWC is satisfied that the continued operation of the
agreement would be unfair for the employees covered by the
agreement; or

(i) the FWC is satisfied that the continued operation of the
enterprise agreement would pose a significant threat to
the viability of a business carried on by the employer, or
employers, covered by the agreement;
(ii) the FWC is satisfied that the termination of the
enterprise agreement would be likely to reduce the
potential of terminations of employment covered by
subsection (2) for the employees covered by the
agreement;
(iii) if the agreement contains terms providing entitlements
relating to the termination of employees’ employment—
each employer covered by the agreement has given the
FWC a guarantee of termination entitlements in relation

requires the job done by the employee to be done by anyone,
except where this is due to the ordinary and customary
turnover of labour; or

###### 226A  Guarantee of termination entitlements
Guarantee of termination entitlements
(1) A
guarantee of termination entitlements
is an undertaking given
by an employer covered by an enterprise agreement that:
(a) is an undertaking that the employer will comply with
subsection (3) if the agreement is terminated under
section 226 and the employer terminates the employment of a
protected employee for the termination of the agreement:
(i) at the employer’s initiative because the employer no
longer requires the job done by the employee to be done

customary turnover of labour; or
(ii) because of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the
employer; and
(b) is in writing; and
(c) meets any requirements relating to the signing of
undertakings that are prescribed by the regulations.
(2) A
protected employee
for a termination of an enterprise agreement
under section 226 is an employee who would, but for the
termination of the agreement, be covered by the agreement.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the employer complies with
this subsection, in relation to the termination of the protected
employee’s employment, if the employer complies with the terms
of the enterprise agreement that, if the agreement were still in
operation, would have provided the employee with entitlements
that:
(a) relate to a termination of the employee’s employment:
(i) at the employer’s initiative because the employer no
longer requires the job done by the employee to be done
by anyone, except where this is due to the ordinary and
customary turnover of labour; or
(ii) because of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the
employer; and
(b) except if the employee was an award/agreement free
employee immediately before the termination of the
employee’s employment—are more beneficial than the
entitlements under a modern award that covered the
employee in relation to the employment at that time.
When guarantee is in force
(4) A guarantee of termination entitlements given in relation to the
termination of an enterprise agreement:
(a) comes into force on the day on which the termination of the
agreement comes into operation under section 227; and

(6) An employer must comply with a guarantee of termination
entitlements given by the employer to the FWC in relation to the
termination of an enterprise agreement if:
(a) the agreement is terminated under section 226; and
(b) the employer terminates the employment of a protected

###### 227A  Application for FWC to reconsider whether an enterprise
###### agreement passes the better off overall test
(1) If the condition in subsection (2) is satisfied, any of the following
may apply to the FWC for a reconsideration of whether an
enterprise agreement passes the better off overall test:
(a) one or more of the employers covered by the agreement;
(b) an employee covered by the agreement;
(c) an employee organisation covered by the agreement.
(2) The condition in this subsection is satisfied if:
(a) before approving the agreement the FWC had regard, under
subsection 193A(6), to patterns or kinds of work, or types of
employment engaged in, or to be engaged in, by:
(i) the award covered employees for the agreement; and
(ii) if the agreement is a single-enterprise agreement that
covers one or more employees to whom a supported
bargaining agreement or a single interest employer
agreement applies
—
those employees; and
(b) at the test time or a later time, one or more employees
covered by subsection (4) or (5) engaged in other patterns or
kinds of work, or other types of employment, to which the
FWC did not have regard under subsection 193A(6).
Example:
Before approving the agreement the FWC had regard, under
subsection 193A(6), to work on Saturdays and Sundays as a pattern of
work for a class of employees. At the test time some employees
covered by subsection (4) worked only on Sundays, and the FWC did
not have regard, under subsection 193A(6), to this pattern of work. In
these circumstances, the condition in this subsection is satisfied.
(4) An employee is covered by this subsection if, on the assumption
that the test time mentioned in paragraph 193(4)(b) were the time

industry or sector (including whether low rates of pay
prevail in the industry or sector); and

common interests; and
(iii) whether the likely number of bargaining representatives
for the agreement would be consistent with a
manageable collective bargaining process; and
(iv) any other matters the FWC considers appropriate; and
(c) the FWC is satisfied that at least some of the employees who
will be covered by the agreement are represented by an
employee organisation.
Note:

(2) A supported bargaining authorisation has no effect to the extent
that it specifies an employee who is covered by a single-enterprise
agreement that has not passed its nominal expiry date.
(3) However, subsections (1) and (2) do not apply if the FWC is
satisfied that the employer’s main intention in making the

covered by the proposed multi-enterprise agreement to which
the authorisation relates;
(c) an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the
industrial interests of an employee in relation to work to be
performed under that agreement.
(4) If an application is made under subsection (3), the FWC must vary
the authorisation to add the employer’s name if the FWC is
satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, taking into
account:
(a) if the employer’s employees are in an industry, occupation or
sector declared by the Minister under subsection 243(2B)—
