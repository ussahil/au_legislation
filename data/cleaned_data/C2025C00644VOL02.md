### Part 2-6—Minimum wages
#### Division 1—Introduction
###### 282  Guide to this Part
This Part provides for the FWC (constituted by an Expert Panel) to
set and vary minimum wages for national system employees. For
employees covered by modern awards, minimum wages are
specified in the modern award. For award/agreement free
employees, minimum wages are specified in the national minimum
wage order.
Division 2 provides for the minimum wages objective. This
requires the FWC to establish and maintain a safety net of fair
minimum wages, taking into account certain social and economic
factors.
Division 3 provides for the FWC (constituted by an Expert Panel)
to conduct annual wage reviews. In an annual wage review, the
FWC may set or vary minimum wages in modern awards, and must
make a national minimum wage order. Minimum wages in modern
awards can also be set, or varied (in limited circumstances), under
Part 2-3 (which deals with modern awards).
Division 4 provides for national minimum wage orders and
requires employers to comply with them. The orders set the
national minimum wage, as well as special national minimum
wages for junior employees, employees to whom training
arrangements apply and employees with a disability. The orders
also set the casual loading for award/agreement free employees.
National minimum wages and special national minimum wages
apply to award/agreement free employees. However, they are also
relevant to other employees as follows:

employee’s base rate of pay under the agreement must
not be less than the relevant national minimum wage or
special national minimum wage (see subsection 206(3)
(in Part 2-4)).
For an employee who is covered by a modern award and to whom
an enterprise agreement applies, the employee’s base rate of pay
under the agreement must not be less than the base rate of pay that
would have been payable to the employee if the award applied (see

###### 284  The minimum wages objective
What is the minimum wages objective?
(1) The FWC must establish and maintain a safety net of fair minimum
wages, taking into account:
(a) the performance and competitiveness of the national
economy, including productivity, business competitiveness
and viability, inflation and employment growth; and
(aa) the need to achieve gender equality, including by ensuring
equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value,
eliminating gender-based undervaluation of work and
addressing gender pay gaps; and
(b) promoting social inclusion through increased workforce
participation; and
(c) relative living standards and the needs of the low paid; and
(e) providing a comprehensive range of fair minimum wages to
junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements
apply and employees with a disability.
This is the
minimum wages objective
.
When does the minimum wages objective apply?
(2) The minimum wages objective applies to the performance or
exercise of:
(a) the FWC’s functions or powers under this Part; and
(b) the FWC’s functions or powers under Part 2-3, so far as they
relate to setting, varying or revoking modern award
minimum wages.
Note:
The FWC must also take into account the objects of this Act and any
other applicable provisions. For example, if the FWC is setting,
varying or revoking modern award minimum wages, the modern
awards objective also applies (see section 134).

###### 306E  FWC may make a regulated labour hire arrangement order
Regulated labour hire arrangement order
(1) The FWC must, on application by a person mentioned in
subsection (7), make an order (a
regulated labour hire
arrangement order
) if the FWC is satisfied that:
(a) an employer supplies or will supply, either directly or
indirectly, one or more employees of the employer to
perform work for a regulated host; and
(b) a covered employment instrument that applies to the
regulated host would apply to the employees if the regulated
host were to employ the employees to perform work of that
kind; and
(c) the regulated host is not a small business employer.
Note:
The FWC may make other decisions under this Part which relate to
regulated labour hire arrangement orders: see Subdivisions C
(short-term arrangements) and D (alternative protected rate of pay
orders) of this Division, and Division 3 (dealing with disputes).
(1A) Despite subsection (1), the FWC must not make the order unless it
is satisfied that the performance of the work is not or will not be
for the provision of a service, rather than the supply of labour,
having regard to the matters in subsection (7A).
(2) Despite subsection (1), the FWC must not make the order if the
FWC is satisfied that it is not fair and reasonable in all the
circumstances to do so, having regard to any matters in
subsection (8) in relation to which submissions have been made.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), it does not matter:

If related bodies corporate with different corporate branding do not
provide labour to each other, a regulated labour hire arrangement
order cannot be made because labour is not supplied in the way
mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

covered employment instrument would apply to the employees, it
does not matter on what basis the employees are or would be
employed.

protected rate of pay
for the regulated employee does not include
any amount that relates to an excluded subject matter within the
meaning of subsection 30A(1) or 30K(1).
Note:
Sections 30D and 30N extend the meaning of
national system
employer
.
(7) If the regulated employee is a pieceworker and paragraph 16(2)(b)
would apply to the employee were the host employment instrument
to apply to the employee, the base rate of pay that would be
payable to the employee for the purposes of subsection (5) of this
section is taken to be the base rate of pay that would be referred to
in that paragraph.
(8) If the regulated employee is a pieceworker and paragraph 18(2)(b)
would apply to the employee were the host employment instrument
to apply to the employee, the full rate of pay that would be payable
to the employee for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) of this
section is taken to be the full rate of pay that would be referred to
in that paragraph.
(9) To avoid doubt, this section does not require that a regulated
employee referred to in subsection (5) be taken to be an employee
other than a casual employee for the purposes of determining
entitlements to kinds of leave, or any other purpose, except
determining the protected rate of pay for the regulated employee.
Requirement to pay no less than protected rate of pay applies
despite other fair work instruments etc.
(10) Subsection (2) applies despite any provision of:
(a) a fair work instrument (other than an instrument made by the
FWC under this Part) that applies to the regulated employee;
or
(b) a covered employment instrument (other than a fair work
instrument) that applies to the regulated employee; or
(c) the regulated employee’s contract of employment;

###### 320  Variation of transferable instruments
Application of this section
(1) This section applies in relation to a transferable instrument that
covers, or is likely to cover, the new employer because of a
provision of this Part.
Power to vary transferable instrument
(2) The FWC may vary the transferable instrument:
(a) to remove terms that the FWC is satisfied are not, or will not
be, capable of meaningful operation because of the transfer
of business to the new employer; or
(b) to remove an ambiguity or uncertainty about how a term of
the instrument operates if:
(i) the ambiguity or uncertainty has arisen, or will arise,
because of the transfer of business to the new employer;
and
(ii) the FWC is satisfied that the variation will remove the
ambiguity or uncertainty; or
(c) to enable the transferable instrument to operate in a way that
is better aligned to the working arrangements of the new
employer’s enterprise.
Who may apply for a variation
(3) The FWC may make the variation only on application by:
(a) a person who is, or is likely to be, covered by the transferable
instrument; or
(b) if the application is to vary a named employer award—an
employee organisation that is entitled to represent the
industrial interests of an employee who is, or is likely to be,
covered by the named employer award.

Matters that the FWC must take into account
(4) In deciding whether to make the variation, the FWC must take into
account the following:
(a) the views of:
(i) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the
new employer; and
(ii) the employees who would be affected by the
transferable instrument as varied;
(b) whether any employees would be disadvantaged by the
transferable instrument as varied in relation to their terms and
conditions of employment;
(c) if the transferable instrument is an enterprise agreement—the
nominal expiry date of the agreement;
(d) whether the transferable instrument, without the variation,
would have a negative impact on the productivity of the new
employer’s workplace;
(e) whether the new employer would incur significant economic
disadvantage as a result of the transferable instrument,
without the variation;
(f) the degree of business synergy between the transferable
instrument, without the variation, and any workplace
instrument that already covers the new employer;
(g) the public interest.
Restriction on when variation may come into operation
(5) A variation of a transferable instrument under subsection (2) must
not come into operation before the later of the following:
(a) the time when the transferable instrument starts to cover the
new employer;
(b) the day on which the variation is made.

#### Division 1—Introduction
###### 321  Guide to this Part
This Part deals with other terms and conditions of employment.
Division 2 is about the frequency and methods of payment of
amounts payable to national system employees in relation to the
performance of work, and the circumstances in which a national
system employer may make deductions from such amounts.
Division 2 also makes it an offence for a national system employer
to fail to pay certain amounts to, on behalf of, or for the benefit of,
a national system employee.
Division 3 is about the guarantee of annual earnings that may be
given to a national system employee whose earnings exceed the
high income threshold. Modern awards do not apply to such an
employee.
Division 4 is about the disclosure of remuneration and other
matters relevant to remuneration outcomes. Terms of contracts of
employment, and other instruments, that purport to prohibit such
disclosures are prohibited.
Division 5 is about fixed term contracts.
A contract of employment must not include a term that provides
the contract will terminate at the end of an identifiable period if:
(a)
the period is greater than 2 years; or
(b)
the contract can be renewed so that the employee is
employed for more than 2 years; or

(c)
in certain circumstances, the employee is employed
under consecutive contracts.
However, such a term may be included in some circumstances,
including where a modern award permits the term.
The Fair Work Ombudsman must prepare a Fixed Term Contract
Information Statement, which must be given to certain current and
prospective employees.
Division 6 is about generally allowing an employee to refuse
contact or attempted contact from their employer (or from a third
party where the contact or attempted contact relates to their work)
outside the employee’s working hours. The FWC may deal with
disputes between an employer and an employee about the right to
disconnect, including by making orders to stop an employee from
refusing contact or to stop an employer from taking certain actions.
Division 7 is about preserving employer-funded paid parental leave
if an employee’s child is stillborn or dies. The employee’s
employer must not refuse to allow the employee to take that leave,
or cancel that leave without a request from the employee.
However, this does not apply if the terms and conditions of the
employee’s employment make express provision relating to
stillbirth or the death of a child.

extent that the group or groups consist of employees of the relevant
employer.
Example:
A proposed multi-enterprise agreement will cover 3 employers: A, B
and C. An application for a protected action ballot order is made under
section 437 and specifies the employees of A and B as the groups of
employees who are to be balloted. Under subsection (2) of this
section:
(a)
an application is taken to have been made specifying the
employees of A; and
(b)
a separate application is taken to have been made specifying the
employees of B.
Subject to section 442, the FWC must deal with each of these 2
applications separately under section 443 and must make separate
protected action ballot orders in relation to the employees of each
employer (if the requirements of section 443 are satisfied in relation to
the employer).
###### 438  Restriction on when application may be made
(1) If one or more enterprise agreements cover the employees who will
be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement, an application
for a protected action ballot order must not be made earlier than 30
days before the nominal expiry date of the enterprise agreement, or
the latest nominal expiry date of those enterprise agreements (as
the case may be).
(2) To avoid doubt, making an application for a protected action ballot
order does not constitute organising industrial action.

(b) the joinder, with the consent of each existing applicant, of
one or more bargaining representatives to an application for a
protected action ballot order;

referred to in paragraph 414(2)(a) being longer than 3 working
days or 120 hours (whichever is applicable), the protected action
ballot order may specify a longer period of up to 7 working days.
Note:

(d) if paragraph (1)(b) applies—the period of 4 hours mentioned
in that paragraph includes the period of overtime to which the
ban applies.
(3) If:
(a) the industrial action is during a shift (or other period of
work); and
(b) the shift (or other period of work) occurs partly on one day
and partly on the next day;
then, for the purposes of this section, the shift is taken to be a day
and the remaining parts of the days are taken not to be part of that
day.
Example:
An employee, who is working a shift from 10 pm on Tuesday until 7
am on Wednesday, engages in industrial action that is not protected
industrial action from 11 pm on Tuesday until 1 am on Wednesday.
That industrial action would prevent the employer making a payment
to the employee in relation to 4 hours of the shift, but would not
prevent the employer from making a payment in relation to the
remaining 5 hours of the shift.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), overtime is taken not to be a
separate shift.

(1) An employee must not:
(a) accept a payment from an employer if the employer would
contravene section 474 by making the payment; or
(b) ask the employer to make such a payment.

subsection if:
(a) an enterprise agreement, or a contract of employment, applies
to the employer and the employee; and
(b) the agreement or contract provides for the employer to stand
down the employee during that period if the employee cannot

#### Division 2—The minimum standards objective
###### 536JX  The minimum standards objective
In performing a function or exercising a power under this Part, the
FWC must take into account the need for an appropriate safety net
of minimum standards for regulated workers, having regard to the
following:
(a) the need for standards that:
(i) are clear and simple; and
(ii) are fair and relevant; and
(iii) recognise the perspectives of regulated workers,
including their skills, the value of the work they perform
and their preferences about their working arrangements;
and
(iv) do not change the form of the engagement of regulated
workers from independent contractor to employee; and
(v) do not give preference to one business model or
working arrangement over another; and
(vi) are tailored to the relevant industry, occupation or sector
and the relevant business models; and
(vii) are tailored to the type of work, working arrangements
and regulated worker preferences; and
(viii) reflect the differences in the form of engagement of
regulated workers as independent contractors to the
form of engagement of employees; and
(ix) have regard to the ability of regulated workers to
perform work under services contracts for multiple
businesses, and the fact that the work may be performed
simultaneously;
(b) in addition to the other matters provided for in this
subsection, the need for standards that deal with minimum
rates of pay that:

Fair Work Act 2009
Compilation No. 69
Compilation date: 07/11/2025
(i) take into account costs necessarily incurred by regulated
workers directly arising from the performance of a
services contract; and
(ii) take into account safety net minimum standards that
apply to employees performing comparable work; and
(iii) do not change the form of the engagement of regulated
workers;
(c) the need to avoid unreasonable adverse impacts upon the
following:
(i) sustainable competition among industry participants;
(ii) business costs, regulatory burden, sustainability,
innovation, productivity or viability;
(iii) administrative and compliance costs for industry
participants;
(iv) the national economy;
(v) persons or bodies that use or rely on the work performed
by regulated workers, or the services received under
services contracts for the performance of that work;
(d) the need to consider other orders or instruments (however
described) made under this Chapter and to avoid unnecessary
overlap of such orders or instruments.
This is the
minimum standards objective

###### 536MX  Terms of a collective agreement that are of no effect
(1) A term of a collective agreement has no effect to the extent that it

#### Division 2—Object of Part
###### 536N  Object of Part
(1) The object of this Part is:
(a) to establish a framework for dealing with unfair contract
terms of services contracts that:
(i) balances the needs of principals and the needs of
independent contractors; and
(ii) addresses the need for a level playing field between
independent contractors and principals by creating
disincentives to the inclusion of unfair contract terms in
services contracts; and
(iii) recognises and protects the freedom of independent
contractors to enter into services contracts; and
(b) to establish procedures for dealing with unfair contract terms
that:
(i) are quick, flexible and informal; and
(ii) address the needs of principals and independent
contractors; and
(c) to provide appropriate remedies if a term of a services
contract is found to be unfair.
(2) The procedures and remedies referred to in paragraphs (1)(b) and
(c), and the manner of deciding on and working out such remedies,
are intended to ensure that a “fair go all round” is accorded to both
the principals and independent contractors concerned.
Note:
The expression “fair go all round” was used by Sheldon J in
re Loty
and Holloway v Australian Workers’ Union
[1971] AR (NSW) 95.
