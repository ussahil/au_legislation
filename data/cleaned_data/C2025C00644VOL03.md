If a person is ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty under a civil
remedy provision in relation to particular conduct, the person is not
liable to be ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty under some other
provision of a law of the Commonwealth in relation to that
conduct.
Note:
A court may make other orders, such as an order for compensation, in

Fair Work Act 2009
107
Compilation No. 69
Compilation date: 07/11/2025
###### 557A  Serious contravention of civil remedy provisions
(1) A contravention of a civil remedy provision by a person is a
serious contravention
if:
(a) the person knowingly contravened the provision; or
(b) the person was reckless as to whether the contravention
would occur.
Note:
For the liability of bodies corporate for serious contraventions, see
section 557B.
Example:
Generally, subsection 323(1) requires an employer to pay an employee
the full amount payable to the employee in relation to the performance
of work.
A contravention of subsection 323(1) is a serious contravention if the
employer knowingly does not pay the employee in full or is reckless
as to whether the failure would occur. It does not matter if the
employer does not know the exact amount of the underpayment.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person is reckless as to
whether a contravention would occur if:
(a) the person is aware of a substantial risk that the contravention
would occur; and
(b) having regard to the circumstances known to the person, it is
unjustifiable to take the risk.
Involvement in a serious contravention
(5A) A person (the
involved person
) who is involved in a contravention
of a civil remedy provision by another person (the
principal
)
commits a
serious contravention
of the provision only if:
(a) the principal’s contravention was a serious contravention;
and
(b) the involved person knew that the principal’s contravention
was a serious contravention.

contravention.
(7) If, in proceedings for an order in relation to a serious contravention
of a civil remedy provision, the court:
(a) is not satisfied that the person has committed a serious
contravention against that provision; and
(b) is satisfied that the person has contravened that provision;

not for the serious contravention but for the contravention of that
provision.
###### 557B  Liability of bodies corporate for serious contravention
(1) For the purposes of subsection 557A(1), a body corporate
knowingly contravenes a civil remedy provision if the body

or
(ii) by regulations made for the purposes of
subsection 535(3) to make available for inspection a
record; or

### Part 6-3A—Transfer of business from a State
### public sector employer
#### Division 1—Introduction
###### 768AA  Guide to this Part
This Part provides for the transfer of certain terms and conditions
of employment when there is a transfer of business from a
non-national system employer that is a State public sector
employer (called “the old State employer”) to a national system
employer (called “the new employer”).
A transfer of business involves the transfer of employment of one
or more employees of the old State employer to the new employer.
Each of those employees is a “transferring employee”.
If there is a transfer of business, then this Part provides for certain
terms and conditions of employment with the old State employer to
be transferred to the employment of the transferring employee with
the new employer.
This Part achieves the transfer of those terms and conditions by
creating a new instrument—a “copied State instrument”—for each
transferring employee. The new instrument is a federal instrument
and is enforceable under this Act.

##### Subdivision A—Guide to this Division
###### 768AF  What this Division is about
If there is a transfer of business, then this Division provides for
certain terms and conditions of a transferring employee’s
employment with the old State employer to be transferred to the
employment with the new employer.
The transfer of those terms and conditions is achieved by creating a
new instrument—called a “copied State instrument”—for the
transferring employee. The new instrument is a federal instrument
that is enforceable under this Act.
There are 2 types of copied State instruments—a copied State
award and a copied State employment agreement.
A copied State award copies the terms of a State award that
covered the transferring employee and the old State employer
immediately before the termination of the employee’s employment
with the old State employer.
A copied State employment agreement copies the terms of a State
employment agreement that covered the transferring employee and
the old State employer immediately before the termination of the
employee’s employment with the old State employer.
##### Subdivision B—Copied State instruments
###### 768AG  Contravening a copied State instrument

Note 2:
For when a copied State instrument for a transferring employee
applies to a person, see section 768AM.
###### 768AH  What is a copied State instrument?
A
copied State instrument
for a transferring employee is the
following:
(a) a copied State award for the employee;
(b) a copied State employment agreement for the employee.
###### 768AI  What is a copied State award?
(1) If, immediately before the termination time of a transferring
employee:
(a) a State award (the
original State award
) was in operation
under the State industrial law of the State; and
(b) the original State award covered (however described in the
original State award or a relevant law of the State) the old
State employer and the transferring employee (whether or not
the original State award also covered other persons);
then a
copied State award
for the transferring employee is taken to
come into operation immediately after the termination time.
Note 1:
Even though a copied State award comes into operation in relation to
the transferring employee, it will not be enforceable by the employee
or another person (for example, the new employer) unless and until it
applies to the employee or other person. In particular, it will not apply
to the employee or new employer before the employee becomes
employed by the new employer. For when the copied State award
applies to a person, see section 768AM.
Note 2:
A copied State employment agreement for the transferring employee
may also come into operation immediately after the termination time,
see subsection 768AK(1). If it does, then the State’s interaction rules
that were in force immediately before the termination time apply for
the purposes of working out the interaction between the copied State
award and the copied State employment agreement (see item 11 of
Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified
way because of section 768BY).

time.
Note:
The State’s instrument content rules that were in force immediately
before the termination time apply to the copied State award (see
item 10 of Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act as that item applies in
a modified way because of section 768BY).
(3) If the terms of the original State award were affected by an order, a
decision or a determination of a State industrial body or a court of
the State that was in operation immediately before the termination
time, the terms of the copied State award are taken to be similarly
affected by the terms of that order, decision or determination.
###### 768AJ  What is a State award?
(1) A
State award
is an instrument in relation to which the following
conditions are satisfied:
(a) the instrument regulates terms and conditions of
employment;
(b) the instrument was made under a State industrial law by a
State industrial body;
(c) the instrument is referred to in that law as an award.

the old State employer and the transferring employee
(whether or not the original State agreement also covered
other persons);
then a
copied State employment agreement
for the transferring
employee is taken to come into operation immediately after the
termination time.
Note 1:
Even though a copied State employment agreement comes into
operation for the transferring employee, it will not be enforceable by
the employee or another person (for example, the new employer)
unless and until it applies to the employee or other person. In
particular, it will not apply to the employee or new employer before
the employee becomes employed by the new employer. For when the
copied State employment agreement applies to a person, see
section 768AM.
Note 2:
A copied State award for the transferring employee may also come
into operation immediately after the termination time, see
subsection 768AI(1). If it does, then the State’s interaction rules that
were in force immediately before the termination time apply for the
purposes of working out the interaction between the copied State
employment agreement and the copied State award (see item 11 of
Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified
way because of section 768BY).
(2) The copied State employment agreement is taken to include the
same terms as were in the original State agreement immediately
before the termination time.
Note:
The State’s instrument content rules that were in force immediately
before the termination time apply to the copied State employment
agreement (see item 10 of Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act as that
item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY).
(3) If the terms of the original State employment agreement were
affected by an order, a decision or a determination of a State
industrial body or a court of the State that was in operation
immediately before the termination time, the terms of the copied
State employment agreement are taken to be similarly affected by
the terms of that order, decision or determination.
(4) If the original State agreement is a collective State employment
agreement, the copied State employment agreement is a
copied
State collective employment agreement

Terms about paid annual leave and personal/carer’s leave
(2) If a copied State instrument for a transferring employee:
(a) includes terms referred to in subsection 93(1) but the terms
do not include the requirements referred to in
subsection 93(2); or
(b) includes terms referred to in subsection 101(1) but the terms
do not include the requirements referred to in

the employee, then subsections 87(3) to (5) have effect, on and
after the employee’s re-employment time, in the same way as they
apply to an award/agreement free employee.
Note:
If the transferring employee qualifies for the shiftworker annual leave
entitlement under those subsections, the employee will be entitled to 5
(rather than 4) weeks of paid annual leave.

(1) While a copied State award for a transferring employee:
(a) covers the employee, or an employer (whether the new
employer or another national system employer) or other
person in relation to the employee; and
(b) is in operation;
a modern award does not cover the employee, or the employer or
other person in relation to the employee.
Note 1:
When the copied State award for a transferring employee ceases to
cover the employee, a modern award will start to cover the employee,
or an employer or other person in relation to the employee.
Note 2:
This subsection may operate in relation to an employer that is not the
new employer in the situation where there has been a later transfer of
business by the new employer (see Part 2-8).
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply for the purposes of section 193
(which is about the better off overall test for enterprise
agreements).
Note:
For the purposes of determining whether an enterprise agreement that
covers a transferring employee passes the better off overall test,

(b) to an employer (whether the new employer or another
national system employer) or another person in relation to the
employee;
then the copied State collective employment agreement for the
employee prevails over the modern award, to the extent of any
inconsistency.
Note 1:
This subsection has effect subject to item 17 of Schedule 9 to the
Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified way because of
section 768BY. That item, as modified, requires that the base rate of
pay under the copied State employment agreement must not be less
than the modern award rate.
Note 2:
This subsection may operate in relation to an employer that is not the
new employer in the situation where there has been a later transfer of
business by the new employer (see Part 2-8).
Copied State individual employment agreements
(2) While a copied State individual employment agreement for a
transferring employee applies:
(a) to the employee; or
(b) to an employer (whether the new employer or another
national system employer) or another person in relation to the
employee;
a modern award does not apply to the employee, or to the employer
or other person in relation to the employee.
Note 1:
However, a modern award can cover the transferring employee while
the copied State individual employment agreement applies.

This subsection has effect subject to item 17 of Schedule 9 to the

##### Subdivision D—Interaction with enterprise agreements
###### 768AU  Enterprise agreements and copied State instruments
(1) While a copied State instrument for a transferring employee covers
the employee and the new employer in relation to the transferring
work, an enterprise agreement that covers the new employer at the
employee’s re-employment time does not cover the employee in
relation to that work.
Note 1:
The fact that a copied State collective employment agreement for a
transferring employee covers the employee does not prevent the
employee and the new employer from replacing that agreement at any
time with an enterprise agreement, regardless of whether the
employee’s copied State collective employment agreement has passed
its nominal expiry date.
Note 2:
Industrial action must not be taken before the nominal expiry date of a
copied State collective employment agreement for a transferring
employee (see item 4 of Schedule 13 to the Transitional Act as that
item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY).
(2) However, if after the re-employment time, another enterprise
agreement starts to cover the employee and the new employer in
relation to the transferring work, then the copied State instrument
for the employee ceases to cover the employee and the new
employer and can never cover them again.

employee:
(a) to remove terms that the FWC is satisfied are not, or will not
be, capable of meaningful operation or to vary those terms so
that they are capable of meaningful operation; or
(b) to remove an ambiguity or uncertainty in the instrument; or
(c) to enable the instrument to operate in a way that is better
aligned to the working arrangements of the new employer’s
enterprise; or
(d) to resolve an uncertainty or difficulty relating to the
interaction between the instrument and the National
Employment Standards, or to make the instrument operate
effectively with the National Employment Standards; or
(e) if the instrument is a copied State employment agreement—
to resolve an uncertainty or difficulty relating to the
interaction between the instrument and a modern award; or
(f) to remove terms that are inconsistent with Part 3-1 (which
deals with general protections), or to vary terms to make
them consistent with that Part.
Note:
Paragraph (d) does not affect a term of the copied State instrument
that is permitted by a provision of the National Employment Standards
as the provision has effect under

Who may apply for a variation
(2) The FWC may make a variation under subsection (1):
(a) on its own initiative; or
(b) on application by a person who is, or is likely to be, covered
by the copied State instrument; or
(c) on application by an employee organisation that is entitled to
represent the industrial interests of an employee who is, or is
likely to be, covered by the copied State instrument.
Note:
The copied State instrument for the transferring employee may also
cover another transferring employee or a non-transferring employee if

Matters that the FWC must take into account
(3) In deciding whether to make a variation under subsection (1), the
FWC must take into account the following:
(a) the views of:
(i) the employees who would be affected by the copied
State instrument as varied; and
(ii) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the
new employer;
(b) whether any employees would be disadvantaged by the
copied State instrument as varied in relation to their terms
and conditions of employment;
(c) if the copied State instrument is a copied State employment
agreement—the nominal expiry date of the agreement;
(d) whether the copied State instrument, without the variation,
would have a negative impact on the productivity of the new
employer’s workplace;
(e) whether the new employer would incur significant economic
disadvantage as a result of the copied State instrument,

#### Division 7—FWC orders about consolidating copied State
#### instruments etc.
##### Subdivision A—Guide to this Division
###### 768BC  What this Division is about
This Division allows the FWC to consolidate the various
workplace instruments that may apply in the new employer’s
workplace. It achieves this by allowing the FWC to make an order
that a copied State instrument for a particular transferring
employee is also a copied State instrument for one or more other
transferring employees or non-transferring employees.
Subdivision B deals with consolidating copied State instruments
for transferring employees. Under that Subdivision, the FWC may
make an order that the copied State instrument for a transferring
employee (“employee A”) is also the copied State instrument for
one or more other transferring employees. If the FWC makes a
consolidation order for those other transferring employees, then
this Act is modified so that the copied State instrument for
employee A is also the copied State instrument for those other
transferring employees (see section 768BF).
Subdivision C deals with non-transferring employees. Under that
Subdivision, the FWC may make an order that the copied State
instrument for employee A (who is a transferring employee) is also
the copied State instrument for one or more non-transferring
employees. If the FWC makes a consolidation order for those
non-transferring employees, then this Act is modified so that the
copied State instrument for employee A is also the copied State
instrument for those non-transferring employees (see
section 768BI).

###### 768BJ  What this Division is about
This Division has a collection of special rules for copied State
instruments for transferring employees.
Subdivision B deals with the case where a copied State instrument
for a transferring employee does not have a term about settling
disputes about matters arising under the instrument. In that case,
the model term prescribed by the regulations is taken to be a term
of the instrument.
Subdivision C is about working out service and entitlements of a
transferring employee. This is particularly relevant for working out
the employee’s entitlements under the National Employment
Standards and the copied State instrument for the employee.
Subdivision D deals with the case where a copied State award for a
transferring employee ceases to operate and the employee suffers a
reduction in take home pay. That Subdivision allows the FWC to
make a take-home pay order to compensate the employee.
Subdivision E modifies particular provisions of this Act in relation
to copied State instruments.
Subdivision F modifies particular provisions of the Transitional
Act in relation to copied State instruments.
Subdivision G modifies particular provisions of the Registered
Organisations Act in relation to copied State instruments.

##### Subdivision B—Terms about disputes
###### 768BK  Where no term dealing with disputes
Model term required
(1) If a copied State instrument for a transferring employee does not
include a term that provides a procedure for settling disputes about
matters arising under the instrument, then the instrument is taken to
include the model term that is determined under subsection (1A)
for settling disputes about matters arising under a copied State
instrument for a transferring employee.
Note:
This section deals with the situation where the original State award or
original State agreement for the copied State instrument did not
include a term about settling disputes about matters arising under the
award or agreement.
Model term determined by FWC
(1A) The FWC must determine a model term for the purposes of
subsection (1).
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1A), the model term determined
for a copied State award for a transferring employee may be the
same or different from the model term determined for a copied
State employment agreement for a transferring employee.
(3) In determining the model term, the FWC must take into account
the following matters:
(a) whether the model term is broadly consistent with
comparable terms in modern awards;
(b) best practice workplace relations as determined by the FWC;
(c) whether all persons and bodies have had a reasonable
opportunity to be heard and make submissions to the FWC
for consideration in determining the model term;
(d) the operation of subsections 739(3), (4), (5) and (6) and
740(3) and (4);

term for settling disputes (see subsection 616(4A)).
Note 2:
For the variation of a determination, see subsection 33(3) of the

(4) A determination under subsection (1A) is a legislative instrument,
but section 42 (disallowance) of the

does not
apply to the determination.
##### Subdivision C—Service and entitlements of a transferring
##### employee
###### 768BL  Service for the purposes of this Act
General rule
(1) Service of a transferring employee with the old State employer that
occurred before the employee’s termination time also counts as
service of the employee with the new employer for the purposes of
this Act (including for the purposes of determining the employee’s
entitlements under the National Employment Standards) after the
employee’s re-employment time.
Gap between termination time and re-employment time
(2) If there is a period of time between the employee’s termination
time with the old State employer and the employee’s
re-employment time with the new employer, then that period:
(a) does not break the employee’s continuous service with the
new employer (taking account of the effect of
subsection (1)); but
(b) does not count towards the length of the employee’s
continuous service with the new employer.

Application of this section
(1) This section applies for the purposes of determining the
entitlements of a transferring employee under the National
Employment Standards, other than entitlements to:
(a) paid annual leave; or
(b) paid personal/carer’s leave.
Note:
For entitlements to paid annual leave and paid personal/carer’s leave
under the National Employment Standards, see section 768BN.
No double entitlement
(2) If, before or after the employee’s termination time, the employee
has the benefit of an entitlement, the amount of which is calculated
by reference to a period of service, then subsection 768BL(1) does
not result in that period of service with the old State employer
being counted again when calculating the employee’s entitlements
of that kind under the National Employment Standards.
(3) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not require the employee to
serve any initial qualifying period of service for long service leave
again.
Limitation on application of general rule to redundancy pay
(4) If the terms and conditions of employment that applied to the
employee’s employment by the old State employer immediately
before the employee’s termination time did not provide for an
entitlement to redundancy pay, then subsection 768BL(1) does not
apply in relation to the employee and the new employer for the
purposes of Subdivision B of Division 11 of Part 2-2 (which deals
with redundancy pay).
(5) If a State industrial body could have made an order giving the
employee an entitlement to redundancy pay (however described),
had the employee’s employment been terminated for redundancy
(however described) before the employee’s termination time, then:

Note:
Because of paragraph (b), the employee may therefore be entitled to
redundancy pay under section 119 if the employee’s employment is
terminated by the new employer during the 12-month period starting
at the employee’s termination time, even if the new employer is a
small business employer.

Application of this section
(1) This section applies for the purposes of determining the
entitlements of a transferring employee under the National
Employment Standards to:
(a) paid annual leave; or
(b) paid personal/carer’s leave;
if the employee had, immediately before the employee’s
termination time, an accrued entitlement to an amount of:
(c) paid annual leave (however described); or
(d) paid personal or carer’s leave (however described).
Note:
For other entitlements under the National Employment Standards, see
section 768BM.
Leave accrued for purposes of the NES
(2) The provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to:
(a) taking that kind of leave (including rates of pay while taking
leave); or
(b) cashing-out that kind of leave;
apply as a minimum standard to the accrued leave, after the
employee’s re-employment time, as if it had accrued under the
National Employment Standards.

(1) If a copied State award for a transferring employee ceases to
operate because of subsection 768AO(2), the cessation is not
intended to result in a reduction in the take-home pay of the
employee.
(2) A transferring employee’s
take-home pay
is the pay the employee
actually receives:
(a) including wages and incentive-based payments, and
additional amounts such as allowances and overtime; but
(b) disregarding the effect of any deductions that are made as
permitted by section 324.
Note:
Deductions permitted by section 324 may (for example) include
deductions under salary sacrificing arrangements.
(3) A transferring employee suffers a

and only if:
(a) when the copied State award for the employee ceases to
operate because of subsection 768AO(2), the employee
becomes a person to whom a modern award applies; and
(b) the employee is employed in the same position as (or a
position that is comparable to) the position he or she was
employed in immediately before the cessation of the copied
State award; and
(c) the amount of the employee’s take-home pay for working
particular hours or for a particular quantity of work after the
cessation of the copied State award is less than what would
have been the employee’s take-home pay for those hours or
that quantity of work immediately before the cessation; and

Compilation No. 69
Compilation date: 07/11/2025
###### 768BS  Orders remedying reductions in take-home pay
(1) If the FWC is satisfied that a transferring employee to whom a
modern award applies has suffered a reduction in take-home pay,
the FWC may make any order (a
take-home pay order
) requiring,
or relating to, the payment of an amount or amounts to the
employee that the FWC considers appropriate to remedy the
situation.
(2) The FWC may make a take-home pay order:
(a) on its own initiative; or
(b) on application by either of the following:
(i) a transferring employee who has suffered a reduction in
take-home pay;
(ii) an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial
interests of the employee.
(3) The FWC must not make a take-home pay order if:
(a) the FWC considers that the reduction in take-home pay is
minor or insignificant; or
(b) the FWC is satisfied that the employee has been adequately
compensated in other ways for the reduction.
(4) The FWC must ensure that a take-home pay order is expressed so
that:
(a) it does not apply to a transferring employee unless the
employee has actually suffered a reduction in take-home pay;
and
(b) if the take-home pay payable to the employee under the
modern award increases after the order is made, there is a
corresponding reduction in any amount payable to the
employee under the order.
(5) If the FWC is satisfied that an application for a take-home pay
order has already been made in relation to a transferring employee,
the FWC may dismiss any later application that is made under
these provisions in relation to the same employee.

Fair Work Act 2009
Compilation No. 69
Compilation date: 07/11/2025
###### 768BT  Contravening a take-home pay order
A person must not contravene a term of a take-home pay order that
applies to the person.
Note:
This section is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4-1).
###### 768BU  How long a take-home pay order continues to apply
A take-home pay order made in relation to a transferring employee
to whom a particular modern award applies continues to apply in
relation to the employee (subject to the terms of the order) for so
long as the modern award continues to cover the employee.
Note:
It does not matter if the modern award stops applying to the employee
because an enterprise agreement starts to apply.
###### 768BV  Interaction of take-home pay orders with modern awards
###### and enterprise agreements
A term of a modern award or an enterprise agreement has no effect
in relation to a transferring employee to the extent that it is less
beneficial to the employee than a term of a take-home pay order
that applies to the employee.
###### 768BW  Application of this Act to take-home pay orders
This Act applies as if the following provisions included a reference
to a take-home pay order:
(a) subsection 675(2) (which is about FWC orders);
(b) subsection 706(2) (which is about powers of inspectors).
##### Subdivision E—Modification of this Act
###### 768BX  Modification of this Act for copied State instruments
This Act has effect in relation to a transferring employee on and
after the employee’s re-employment time as if a reference in a

included a reference to the term referred to in column 3.

dispute (other than by arbitration) have been, or are likely to be,
unsuccessful, then:
(a) the FWC must issue a certificate to that effect; and

permission to be represented by the representative.
(2) The FWC may make an order for costs against the representative
for costs incurred by the other party to the dispute if the FWC is

because:
(a) the representative encouraged the person to start, continue or
respond to the dispute and it should have been reasonably
apparent that the person had no reasonable prospect of
success in the dispute; or
(b) of an unreasonable act or omission of the representative in
connection with the conduct or continuation of the dispute.
