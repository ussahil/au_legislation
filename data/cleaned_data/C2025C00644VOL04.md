Fair Work Act 2009
Compilation No. 69
Compilation date: 07/11/2025
(2) Subclause (1) does not prevent regulations made for the purposes
of section 789BC of the amended Act, or clause 7 of this Part,
from
dealing with the effect, in relation to a person who is taken by
section 789BB of the amended Act to be an employee, of matters
that occurred before commencement.
###### 3  Effect on TCF contract outworker’s entitlements
Accrued entitlements not affected
(1) The amendments made by the amending Act do not affect any
entitlement that a TCF contract outworker had accrued before

Effect of modern award term requiring National Employment
Standards to be applied to TCF contract outworker
(2) To avoid doubt, if:
(a) a term of a modern award requires the principal of a TCF
contract outworker to apply the National Employment
Standards to the outworker as if the outworker were an
employee; and

outworker is taken to be an employee (being a national
system employee) of the principal for the purposes of
Part 2-2 of the amended Act (the National Employment
Standards);
then, to the extent that the term gives the outworker an entitlement
that is the same as an entitlement (the
NES entitlement
) of the
outworker (as a national system employee) under the National
Employment Standards, the term operates in parallel with the
outworker’s NES entitlement, but not so as to give the outworker a
double benefit.
